This is a repository containing the code of the 25 hackerrank exercises for assignement 2 of Principles of Computer Science 2. The exercises are organised based on their types (strings, algorythms, etc...). Here is the link to my profile: https://www.hackerrank.com/romainpastre51?hr_r=1

The code of each problem can be find as individual files in their respective directories. All the exercises ordered with the link to each problem on hackerrank can also be found in the all_exercises.ipynb jupyter file.
