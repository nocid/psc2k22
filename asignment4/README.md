This is a repository containing the code of the 10 Rosalind exercises for assignement 4 of Principles of Computer Science 2. The exercises are organised in one jupyter notebook file, with an additionnal file containing the sequences and their outputs when required by the exercise. Here is the link to my Rosalind profile: https://rosalind.info/users/Nocide/

Sometimes the files contain code of different ways of solving the problem or code that does not give the right output but is still useful.
